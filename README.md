# Advent of Code 2024

Puzzle inputs downloaded with [aoc-cli](https://github.com/scarvalhojr/aoc-cli), stored one folder per day.

All done with AI (Codeium windsurf editor) with upgraded November Claude 3.5 sonnet

### prompt used for easy problems:

```
solve day 3, try on sample input, think step by step
```

### prompt used for harder problems:

```
read the day 25 2023 problem carefully, make a plan to solve, optimize it for large inputs (so ideally low O complexity algorithm), try first on test input and then run on real input
```

and then

```
it takes too long even for test input, try to find more ways to optimize, be sure to avoid infinite loops
```
